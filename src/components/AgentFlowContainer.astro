  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    This example looks at Embedded Insurance in Germany.
    Multiple parties collaborate to offer insurance within a digital product
    or customer journey.
  </p>

  <div class="step">
    <span class="label">Step 1 · Different viewpoints</span>
    <p>
      Insurers, platform operators, partners and compliance teams
      often use the same terms — but mean slightly different things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each interpretation is shaped by role, responsibility
      and regulatory exposure.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <span class="label">Step 2 · Where friction starts</span>
    <p>
      These differences usually stay hidden.
      They surface late — during contracts, audits, integrations or incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is when alignment becomes expensive.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <span class="label">Step 3 · Making meaning explicit</span>
    <p>
      WikiSure™ makes these differences visible — before they turn into friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terms are reviewed from multiple perspectives
      and documented in a shared, transparent way.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <span class="label">Step 4 · Structured review</span>
    <p>
      A structured review clarifies whether a definition
      can be reused as-is, needs alignment,
      or must be escalated.
    </p>

    <div class="outcome">
      <strong>Illustrative outcome</strong>
      <p>
        The definition is acceptable with conditions.
        Minor clarification is required before reuse.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <span class="label">Step 5 · What changes</span>
    <p>
      Once meaning is aligned, teams move faster
      and decisions become easier to justify.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less back-and-forth. Fewer assumptions. Faster execution.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="final">
    <h2>Why this matters</h2>
    <p>
      WikiSure™ does not replace insurers, platforms or regulators.
      It creates a shared semantic reference
      that supports human judgment instead of bypassing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alignment happens early — while change is still cheap.
    </p>
  </div>
