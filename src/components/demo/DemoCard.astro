  <strong>Governance Outcome (Illustrative):</strong>

  <div class="explain">
    From a <strong>platform perspective</strong>, the proposed definition is
    <em>acceptable with conditions</em>.
    <br /><br />
    This means the concept can move forward — but only if
    documentation is aligned, partners share the same interpretation,
    and regulatory expectations are respected.

<!-- FINAL AHA -->
<h2>Why this matters for platforms</h2>

<div class="explain">
  As a platform provider, you integrate insurance into products, journeys
  and ecosystems — often across multiple partners and jurisdictions.
  <br /><br />
  WikiSure™ gives you a <strong>shared semantic governance layer</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>definitions are explicit, not implicit</li>
    <li>AI suggestions are supervised, not autonomous</li>
    <li>decisions are explainable, not opaque</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  The result: faster rollout of embedded insurance — without losing
  regulatory control or human accountability.
